ESP32-Artnet-Wifi-Node-With-Pin-Settings
Public

See Original Repo for details and configuration. This repo simply adds a fix for updating the pin outputs and allows assignment of pins (with no validation atm, use with caution!)

I'm new to C and microcontrollers. Not sure the best syntax to handle setting `initLed`, so open a PR if you find a fix.

Will add ethernet later when i can test on my own and add config for skipping ethernet logic.
